Inventory System Management for Envin Engineering Enterprise using PHP, Bootstrap and MySQL.

## Project Description
Inventory Management System is a Web Application made using PHP, SQL, and the components of Web Development. Inventory management refers to the process of ordering, storing, and using a company's inventory. This includes the management of raw materials, components and finished products, as well as warehousing and processing such items. To achieve these balances, we have developed this project.
Knowing when to restock inventory, what amounts to purchase or produce, what price to pay—as well as when to sell and at what price—can easily become complex decisions. An efficient Inventory Management helps us to achieve all that. 
This project easily reduces the manual work of managing the inventory with a cleaner UI and an easy-to-use application.
